'''
 Extended sequence unpacking always return a list for multiple matched items.
 Slice returns a sequence of the same type as the object sliced.

 If nothin left to the starred name, it is assigned an empty list.

'''
 Mutable objects, like set, list, dict, shared by names would ran into unexpected result.
 Use tuple assignements or assigning separated to solve this problem.
 Check the script "SharedReferenced_and_InPlaceChange_of_Type_Mutable_And_Set"
